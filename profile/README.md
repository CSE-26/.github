# CSE 26 
### Class of 2026: Because someone has to ...

## Who We Are
Just a bunch of computer science students trying to figure out why our code works when it shouldn't, and doesn't when it should. Batch of 2026, at your service.

## What We Do
- Turn trash into code which is still trash (with varying success rates)
- Build cool stuff (that sometimes works)
- Pretend to understand data structures
- Actually help each other out (when ChatGPT fails us)

## Why tho?
- Project Hub: From games to AI - join existing projects or start your own. Simple as that.
- Hackathon Squad: We team up, we build cool stuff, we survive on coffee and tea. Join us, you incel!
